This is a project work on datasets and analysis I worked on as a course project for Programming for Engineers, SENG207
a first semester course I read in my second year at the University of Ghana. In this project, Python was the major 
language and Libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc.Where imported to assist in making this project a success.
The whole aim of this project was to examine close to 1600 entries of constraints in wine-production. The entries were described,
plots and graphs drafted to give meanings the data. A report is included in this repository that explains the outcomes in details.
